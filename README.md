Made this crypo dashboard using React.The project comes in applications of Banking and Financing Websites/Apps. The whole project is made with Chakra UI. Integrated it for the first time in a project.
Used the latest version of Chakra. Chakra V3. 

The use of component library made the project development rapid. Prevented me from writing usable components/code again and again.


Here is a demo link for the dashboard->https://react-crypto-dashboard-chakra-ui.vercel.app/
